<!-- ## 💫 About Me -->

## Hi there, I'm Sara 👋 

I’m a returning Information Security professional with early-career roots in cybersecurity,  back when the field was still taking shape.  
After years contributing to different pillars of the organization, such as contract management and vendor governance, I’ve come full circle to my original passion: protecting people and organizations through knowledge, structure, and integrity.

### My focus areas include:
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM) Governance**
- **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)**
- **Human-Centric Cybersecurity**
- **Current Project:** Building the [Creator Security & AI Governance Framework](Link-to-your-repo).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Cloud:** AWS (IAM, S3, CloudTrail)
- **GRC:** NIST CSF, ISO 27001, AI Risk Management Framework (RMF)
- **IAM:** OAuth 2.0, RBAC, NHI Lifecycle Management
- **Documentation:** Markdown, Technical Writing, Risk Registering

I’m inspired by the work of [Women in Identity](https://womeninidentity.org), particularly their Code of Conduct: *“The Human Impact of Identity Exclusion.”*  
This principle reminds me that technology should empower, not exclude. I believe fairness, inclusion, and access are as vital to cybersecurity as any control or framework.

Every control, access request, and audit trail represents a person trusting the system to do right by them, and that trust deserves to be honored.
